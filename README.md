There has been a lot of talk online about the Stephen Ridley masterclass, primarily around the cost of it and what you get at the end of it. There is also the sales pitch when selling the course. It's very intense and you have to 'BUY NOW' in full without being able to sample any of the course beforehand. Then there is the 'lifetime guarantee' which says you can get a refund even if you have owned the course for 15 years. Only you can't. So, I have decided to make at least part of the course available so you can see for yourselves the style, delivery and content of the course before deciding to part with your hard earned cash.

These are links to the 4 Chord videos that you may see pop up on a advert while watching a Youtube video. They are Wistia links. The Ridley Academy uses this hosting site to embed the videos in its own site.

Ridley masterclass level 1 
This is the entire contents of level 1 from Stephen Ridleys masterclass course. If you don't know, the course is split into 10 levels and by the time you reach level 10 you are supposed to have and excellent grasp of the piano. The claims are that it takes around 6 months playing just 3 minutes a day to reach the end of the course. I finished watching level 1, a tenth of the course and hadn't even played a note on the piano.
